<!--
Why not put scripts at the end of the body container like in a traditional web page? The aforementioned approach usually
allows the page to render faster, as static HTML and CSS can be displayed before the JavaScript finishes loading.

NOTE: SPAs donâ€™t work like that.
They generate the HTML with JavaScript, and therefore placing the scripts outside the header does not result in faster
rendering. Instead, keep all of the external scripts in the head section to improve organization and legibility.
